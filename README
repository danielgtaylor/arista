Generating a Test File
----------------------
Sometimes it may be useful to generate a test file:

    gst-launch-0.10 videotestsrc num-buffers=500 ! x264enc ! mp4mux ! filesink location=test.mp4

Creating New Device Presets
---------------------------
New device presets can be created by specifying information about yourself and 
the device you wish to support along with presets that describe how to create a
proper gstreamer pipeline to encode for the device in an xml file. Please see 
the xml files in the presets directory that ship with Arista for examples.
